#Tic-Tac-D'oh! is a bulletin board system (BBS) emulator in the form of an arcade game. You will experience packet loss and possibly call disconnections as you battle your nemesis. You can win, lose, or draw, and yes, you can use an Xbox360 game controller.



##Update: 
###The call disconnection bug has been fixed.
